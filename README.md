# Password_Generator

## Description 

This is my humble but effective Password Generator! 

The application is simple. You will press "Generate Password" which will lead to a series of prompts. The first one will ask you how long you want your password to be, from 8 - 128 characters. Next, the application will ask you if you want lowercase, uppercase, numeric and/or special characters. You will choose what you want and the password will appear!

This was a very difficult task for me as I am brand new to Javascript. But I think I did it well, with some major discoveries at the eleventh hour! Enjoy!
